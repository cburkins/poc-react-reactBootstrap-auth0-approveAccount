# Background

This is the 3rd part of my 2nd attempt at using Auth0 for user authentication in a React app. The goals of this POC was to use my existing Auth0 configuration, with the addition of admin approval required for new accounts

My plan is to follow this suggestion: https://community.auth0.com/t/how-to-prevent-logging-in-until-admin-approval/9340/2

I built this POC using:

-   React
-   Bootstrap (via react-bootstrap, not reactstrap)
-   Auth0 (via @auth0/auth0-spa-js)
