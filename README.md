# Background

This is the 3rd part of my 2nd attempt at using Auth0 for user authentication in a React app. The goals of this POC was to use my existing Auth0 configuration, with the addition of admin approval required for new accounts

I built this POC using:

-   React
-   Bootstrap (via react-bootstrap, not reactstrap)
-   Auth0 (via @auth0/auth0-spa-js)
